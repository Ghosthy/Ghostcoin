GhostCoin (GHC)

GhostCoin is an innovative, secure and energy efficient PoW/PoS coin. It uses a faster PoW distribution mechanism to distribute the initial coins, then after 8 weeks the coin is basically transferred to a pure PoS coin, where the generation of the coin is mainly through the PoS interests.

GhostCoin also adopt a variable PoS rate, which gives the highest payout at 20% the first year, then increase 5% every 2 years until the 7th year it reaches annual interest rate of 5%, then it will remain at this rate.

Because after 8 weeks it is basically a pure PoS coin, it does not need to be intensively mined, as the PoW payout will remain the minimum. Most coins will be generated through PoS, thus it is a coin that will save a lot of energy compared to other coins.

GhostCoin will have a total of 750 million coins. Initially each block will deliver 1000 to 9000 coins randomly. The PoW payout will be halved each week (7 days). After 8 weeks, the PoW payout will be fixed at 1 coin per block.

PoS will start after at least 20 days of holding of the coins in the wallet. With PoS, the coin is more resilient to 51% attack.
